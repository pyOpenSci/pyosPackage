## Development

* TODO: link to development docs when they exist and move the text below to the
docs.

### Linting & Code Formatting

TODO: this will be added to the docs once they are created in a separate pr.

All linting and code formatting is implemented in this package using a combination
of pre-commit hooks and Ruff. Ruff is a fast, rust-based linter and code
formatter that covers functionality previously implemented by Black and isort
(formatters that are commonly used in the Python ecosystem). Ruff simplifies
your linting and code format setup but running all of the checks and fixes
using a single tool. As such pyOpenSci encourages new projects to consider
using Ruff.
