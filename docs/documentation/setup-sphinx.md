# Sphinx documentation

This package uses Sphinx to create documentation.

We like sphinx because it is a community driven project with a community
driven theme that the scientific Python community works on:

`pydata_sphinx_theme`

:::{note}
MkDocs is the other most common documentation tool used in the Python
ecosystem.

## Setup your documentation

You can chose to create sphinx documentation using sphinx-quickstart.
Below is the Sphinx-quickstart workflow used to create these docs. However,
inevitably you will likely customize the documentation setup. So you may also
want to just copy this repository's structure.

```bash
âžœ sphinx-quickstart
Welcome to the Sphinx 5.3.0 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: docs

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
> Project name: pyosPackage
> Author name(s): pyOpenSci Community
> Project release []: 1.10

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
> Project language [en]: en
```

## About the conf.py file

The `conf.py` file is what Sphinx uses to configure your documentation. This is
where you setup all of the features that you want your documentation to have.

:::{note}
Every tool and theme that you might use will have different configuration options
that will be placed in the `conf.py` file.

## API / Reference documentation

It's useful to have a reference section in your docs that contains documentation
for your package's methods and classes. In this demo package we are using
autodoc2 which will create these reference docs for you automatically.

We like `autodoc2` over `sphinx_autodoc` extension because it supports `myst`
markdown.
